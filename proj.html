    <P id="riko">About me</P>
    <p id="roho"> I generally like leaning about new things and can't feel comfortable
    when I lack idears on something which is neccessary and others are able to
   do or make it.So I always try my level best to reach there .I feel this is the only
   way I will be at the same pace with others and be able to face the challeges created
    by the lifestyle of today</p>
